# monogame-demo
The purpose of this project was to create a flexible library for 2D games in MonoGame, and also to make a demo game for it.
Rather than doing anything revolutionary, this project was meant to focus on good coding practices.

# "Final"
This folder contains a small space shooter demo called Nebulaxa. Destroy all of the green enemy bases to win the level, destroy other things to improve your score. (Basically, a simpler rip-off of Bosconian.)

# "MGLIB"
This is where the library is contained. It separates out functionality like:
* Input Handling
* Controls & Player
* Sprites
* Collisions
* Camera
* Parallax Scrolling
* Simple UI
